How it Works:
1️Twilio Reads the TwiML

Twilio sees the <Stream> tag and starts streaming live audio to WebSocket (wss://ngrok-server/ws).

The TwiML itself is just an instruction for Twilio; it does not get sent anywhere.

2️Audio is Sent via WebSocket

Twilio sends raw audio to WebSocket server in real-time.

WebSocket server receives the audio and forwards it to Google's bidirectional API.

3️Google Gemini Processes the Audio & Responds

Google's bidirectional audio API processes the speech and returns a synthesized voice response.

4 WebSocket Sends the Response Back to Twilio

WebSocket receives Gemini’s audio and streams it back to Twilio.

Twilio plays the audio to the caller in real-time.
